I’m just getting started and want to tell the app a bit about my health and what I eat, so it can recommend a fitness and meal plan that really fits my needs.

I have some foods I can’t eat (or just really dislike), so I’d love it if the system only suggests meals I’m actually able and willing to try.

My schedule is pretty packed—I need my workouts planned around the days and times I’m actually free, so I can stay on track without stressing out.

As a vegetarian, I’d like meal plans that help me hit my protein goals without any meat, so I can stay healthy and happy with what I eat.

Since I’m new to exercising, I want easy-to-follow routines, with tips for good form and safety reminders, so I don’t risk getting hurt.

Because I have a past injury, I want reassurance that my workout won’t include moves that could make it worse—and can be adapted to me.

Big goals feel overwhelming. I’d appreciate it if the app could break them down into specific steps for each week and day, so I always know exactly what to focus on next.

I’m motivated by seeing progress! I want to be able to check my plans, results, and milestones whenever I want to see how far I’ve come.

Sometimes I get confused or have questions. It would be great to chat with the AI for advice—like why it picked certain foods, or what else I could eat.

My goals and circumstances change, so I want my plans to update too—whenever I hit a milestone or decide to try something new, the app should keep up with me.
